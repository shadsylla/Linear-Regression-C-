 we will preform Linear regression on multiple variables.

 three member functions: 
 1. Mean 
 2.Standard deviation 
 3. Normalization 


 After writing the code, the data is Normalized. 


 After the Normalization is done. We will use train, test and split.
 The last function will spilt our data into testing sets of data.


 note: this function() -1 ; all it means is the last one.
